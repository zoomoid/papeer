# papeer

`papeer` [***papier***, *german for paper*] is a Golang CLI application that templates TeX files to wrap given PDF files with extra space for annotations etc.

> The project is under development as currently does not work. It requires a TeX compiler and we have yet to make considerations regarding implementation of this dependency.

papeer will also include a gRPC server to receive requests via API calls.
